Elastic Stack is a group of open-source applications from Elastic designed to take data from any source and in any format and then search, analyze, and visualize 
that data in real time.  it was formerly known as ELK stack which means Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. 
Ekasticsearch : is used to store logs
kibana: To search, view and interact with data stored in Elasticseach indices , allowing advance data analyis and visualizing data in a variety of charts, tables and maps.
Beats: are open source data shippers that can be installed as agents on servers to send operational data directly to Elasticsearch or via Logstash
Logstash: a powerfool tool that integrates with a wide variety of deployments. 

In few words
Filebeats collecs data from the log files and sends it to logstash
Logstash enhances the data and sends it to Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch store and indexes the data
Kibana displays the data stored in Elasticsearch


Instal EFK using Helm
kubectl create ns efk
helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co
helm repo update
helm repo search elastic
helm show values elastic/elasticseach >>elasticseach.values
#To deploy elatic search in the efk namespace you ave to pass -ns efk
#Since you alreeady redirected the values to another values and you have edited somenthing in it pass -f name of the file your redirected into
helm install elastic elastic/elasticseach -ns efk -f elasticserach.values


To install kibana
Since the elasic repo has been added to your helm and it has kibana
heml repo show elastic
#you will see elastic/kibana
heml show value elastic/kibana
helm install kibana elastic/kibana -n efk (you don't have to run -f since the values was not redirected to another file neither was the values changed)

You don't have to create a Nodeport or Loadbalncer for kibana when instaklling because it already install ingress when installing it
We will create an ingress group using ingress kubernetes objects using host base routing
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: KIBANA
spec:
  ingressClassName:nginx
  rules:
  - host: KIBANA.DOMINION.COM 
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: 
        backend:
          serviceName: USE kubectl get svc -n efk to see the name of the service created for kibana to input it here
            port: USE kubectl get svc -n efk to see the port under service created for kibana to input it here
GO TO AWS TO CREATE HOSTNAME KIBANA.DOMINION.COM USING  ROUTE53 
            
            
            
 Use the same process to install filebeat
helm install filebeat elastic/filebeats
