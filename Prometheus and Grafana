Prometheus is an open source system that collects and manages server and application metrics. It can be configured to notify your team when an issue arrises
Grafana is an open source tool allows you to easily visualize information ( it collect information from server monitoring tools like prometheus to display information)
Prometheus can check for request time 
To install Prometheus
Use the command "kubectl create ns apm" to create a namespace
Use the command "kubectl config set-content --current --namespace=apm" to get into the namespace
helm repo add prometheus https://charts.heml.sh/stable 
helm search repo prometheus  (select the one that says prometheus/prometheus)
You can run "helm show value prometheus
if you don't like what is written in it, run this command
helm show value prometheus > value.yml
Then vi into value.yml to edit it to what you want
You can run "helm template apm/prometheus"
heml intsall prometheus "they first name you saw after you search for prometheus" prometheus/prometheus
If you redirect the show values into another file to install the changes you made in the new file erun this command
helm install prometheus promethus/prometheus -f value.yml
If you want to install with the default "show value" file run this command:
helm install prometheus promethus/prometheus 


Note if the command above to work dirctly on the apm namespace does not work then if you want to install it you have to pass the namespace:
helm install prometheus promethus/prometheus -n apm
